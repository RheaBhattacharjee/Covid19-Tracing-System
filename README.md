# Covid19-tracing-system
The web application devised by us logs all individuals that are 
visiting a particular establishment. The system has 2 sides of 
the interface which are the Admin Panel and therefore 
the Establishments Log’s Side.
The Admin Panel is that the module of the project which are 
the supervisor will manage all the info like the list of 
establishments and Individuals List. The system automatically 
generates a printable CTS QR Code Card (Contact Tracing System 
Quick Response Code Card) and this card are going to be the 
identification of the individuals for entering the establishment.
Talking about the Establishment Log’s Side, each 
establishment that’s registered within the system will create a 
system-generated code which can be employed by the 
establishment’s staff to access the QR Code Scanning Feature. This 
module has only one page after login because this side purpose is 
merely to log the visitor’s QR Code to log their information to the 
system that the individual has entered to the specific 
establishment during a certain time and date. This project also 
generates printable reports.
